PowerVR SGX530 drivers for TI OMAP3
===================================

This is user space part of graphics drivers used on mobile devices based on
Texas Instruments OMAP3 platform. These include Nokia N900, N950, N9.

It consists of development headers, OpenGL ES libraries and some "glue" between
kernel and user space parts.

There are two SGX530 core revisions used in different devices:
 * 1.2.1 is for OMAP34xx, OMAP35xx, AM35xx Rev.3.1
 * 1.2.5 is for AM37xx, DM37xx, AM387x, C6A814x, AM389x, C6A816x, 811x, AM335x

SGX core revision is automatically detected by the init script and proper
symlink is then created, so the user doesn't need to worry about it.

This work is based on Nemo/Mer graphics driver which was downloaded from:
